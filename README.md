# Goblin Scurry

**Goblin Scurry** is a tiny, self-contained game made in Godot.

You play as a goblin who automatically scurries back and forth across the screen, collecting gold with every edge bonk. Use that gold to buy a few simple upgrades.

### About

> My first attempt at finally making and completing a game, no matter how small.

This project was made to push through the finish line — a complete little game, exported and shared.

---

### How to Play

- Launch `Goblin Scurry.exe` (or open the project in Godot).
- Watch the goblin collect gold as he hits the edges.
- Spend gold on one-time upgrades:
  - **Pockets** — carry more gold per trip
  - **Feet** — move faster
  - **Wagon** — boost both speed and gold haul
- Reach 100 gold to win.
